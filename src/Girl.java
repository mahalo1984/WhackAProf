/**
* This class is currently a stub and has not been implemented.
* <p>
* This class is a particular kind of <code>Mole</code>. It is mostly a factory for making moles with
* the properties of a <code>Girl</code>. Distinct to this <code>Mole</code> are its sprites and its 
* uptime and waiting and point values which are all set in the {@link Globals} class. It also overrides
* the basic mole <code>kill()</code> method to randomly reassign uptimes and wait times for when the
* mole spawns to a new <code>Seat</code>.
* <p>
* The girl mole concept is introduced as a response to a balancing issue with button mashing. In a 
* future version, the girl mole will penalize the player for hitting her.
*
